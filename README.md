# TE0-TE1-Mode-Converter-BPM
 
## Contents
- get_modes.m: Compute the TE0/TE1 modes in the 2D slab waveguide using the effective-index method.
- input_WG.m: Compute the resultant field at the output port of the SiO<sub>2</sub>/Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> slab waveguide with no perturbations.
- single_simulation.m: Computes the complex E-field profiles along the transverse and propagation directions in the periodic perturbation-based TE0/TE1 mode converter using the Beam Propagation Method. The overlap integral of the propagating field with the TE0/TE1 are computed at every z-step to monitor the modal powers.
